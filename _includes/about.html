                My research interests are in computer graphics, computer vision, and related fileds, including 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, rendering techniques, global illumination, generative AI, object detection/tracking, and multi-modal learning. I conduct research to create a world where people can seamlessly move between the real and virtual worlds through XR technology.
